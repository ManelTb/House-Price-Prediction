## 📌 Project Overview

This project focuses on predicting **house prices** using real-world data and **Machine Learning techniques**.  
It includes **data exploration, preprocessing, model training, evaluation, and visualization**.  

The goal is to understand the key factors that influence house prices and to build predictive models that can estimate prices accurately.

## 🎯 Objectives

1. Perform **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)** to understand the dataset.  
2. Handle missing values and encode categorical variables.  
3. Train and compare multiple regression models:  
   - **Linear Regression**  
   - **Random Forest Regressor**  
   - **XGBoost Regressor**  
4. Evaluate models using **RMSE** and **R² score**.  
5. Visualize model predictions and feature importance.
